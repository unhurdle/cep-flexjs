# CEP
CEP contains type information for `cep` and `__adobe_cep` global objects used in Adobe CEP HTML extensions. This swc is meant to be included in CEP Royale projects as "typedef" libraries (i.e. using the external-library-path compiler argument). The swcs should not be used to cross-compile javascript code.
